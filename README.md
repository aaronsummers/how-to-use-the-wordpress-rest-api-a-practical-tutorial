The WordPress REST API was first introduced with version 4.7 and brought fantastic opportunities and functionality to WordPress development. The WordPress REST API provides API endpoints for WordPress data types, allowing developers to interact with sites remotely by sending and receiving JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. This means now you can build websites, mobile apps, desktop apps, all based on WordPress from the back-end, but “without” WordPress on the front-end.
